My address is Flat 116, 19, Pionerskaya Street. My phone number is 41-5-81. I am a pupil. I go to school Number 1. I am a good pupil. I do well in all subjects. They say that I am a hard-working person. To tell the truth, all school subjects come easy to me but sometimes I have to work long hours, for example, to do lessons in Physics or Chemistry, to write a composition or to learn a poem by heart. But my favourite subject is English. I spend a lot of time on it reading books, doing tests etc. Maybe English and learning it will be a part of my future carreer. I like reading. I think comics and detective stories are much easier to read but I prefer to read novels - historical or modern. I like music. My musical tastes are different, it depends on my mood. But I think every apple is good in its season. I play the piano and the guitar, not seriously but for my soul. Sometimes I like to listen to Russian classical music. My favourite composers are Chaikovsky and Mozart. I also like Russian folk songs but I don\'t like rock music. I don\'t have much time to watch TV but sometimes I spend an hour or two watching an interesting film or a news programme. In the evening I often read newspapers (our local ones) or magazines. I like fresh air and exercise. I wish I had more time for doing sports. But some aerobics in the morning, a swimming pool twice a week, a ski-walk on a frosty day are of great help. Sport is fun. I have a wide circle of interests. I\'m very sociable, so I get on very well with people. I have many friends, most of them are my classmates. We spend a lot of time together going out to the cinema or to a disco party, speaking about lessons and music, discussing our problems. But most of all I like my family. We all are great friends and deeply attached to each other. That\'s all about me - a person with her good and not very good traits of character, liking this and hating that. But it\'s interesting for me to live and to open new things.','ru' => 'My name is Natalia. My surname is Govorova. I am 15. I was born in 1982 in Chelyabinsk.
